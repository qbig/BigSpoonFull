###Step1: Big Idea/Concept

￼￼Unique Name: BigSpoon

Idea: Personal Waiter on the Mobile Phone.

Allow customers to get their orders to the restaurant immediately without needing to wait for a waiter to take their orders.

Allow restaurants to receive orders seamlessly and reduce the number of waiters they need to hire for taking orders.

###Step 2: Target User/User Persona

There are 2 target users. The restaurant manager and the customer. There is also a target beneficary, the restaurant owner.

The restaurant owner has received complaints from customers about the waiting time, especially during peak hours. He wants to reduce the waiting time and it will require the hiring of more waiters, but he does not have the money to do so. It is also difficult for him to hire extra waiters for only the few hours during the peak hours.

The restaurant manager is a 38 year old employee of a restaurant who is used to taking orders from pieces of paper that waiters pass to him.

The customer is a 30 year old white collar worker who visits restaurants during the peak hours.
He faces long waiting times between sitting down at a table in the restaurant to having a waiter take the order from him. He often has to try and get the waiter's attention for the waiter to take his orders.
He also faces long waiting times between having his order taken and receiving the food.

He also notices that the waiter walks around to a few other tables before passing all the orders to the kitchen, because other customers also called for the waiter to make requests for things like water, napkins.
